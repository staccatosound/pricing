Binary Search Tree
Recent Articles on Binary Search Tree !
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the nodeÅfs key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the nodeÅfs key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
